    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://class.coursera.org/automata-004">Automata course</a> was six weeks long. Before taking the course I had some prior knowledge about <code>automata</code>, <code>regular expressions</code>, <code>context free grammar</code>, <code>turing machine</code> and <code>np-completeness</code>. In my opinion most of the lectures was clear and understandable. I found it very helpful to have a quizzes during each one. They were keeping me up on the track for a whole time. After each module there was a homework consisting of some test questions. For me those homeworks were the most valuable components of the course. It helped me a lot to fully understand the materials.</p>

<p>Of course not everything was straight forward. The most dificult topic, for me, was <code>np-completeness</code>. To be honest I didn’t fully understand it. I can only guessing that it was caused by the fact that I haven’t spent as much time during study as I should. Maybe I will return to that but now there are much more important things to do on top of my todo list.</p>

<p>After taking a final exam I have earned <code>Statement of Accomplishment</code> attached below.</p>

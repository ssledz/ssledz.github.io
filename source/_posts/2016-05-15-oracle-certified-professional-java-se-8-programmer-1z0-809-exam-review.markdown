Just after passing [Java SE 8 Programmer 1Z0-808 Exam](https://education.oracle.com/pls/web_prod-plq-dad/db_pages.getpage?page_id=5001&get_params=p_exam_id:1Z0-808)
(about that you can read [here]({% post_url 2016-05-15-oracle-certified-associate-java-se-8-programmer-1z0-808-exam-review %})) 
and being impressed by [OCA: Oracle Certified Associate Java Se 8 Programmer I Study Guide: Exam 1z0-808](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23059696-oca?from_search=true&search_version=service),
I decided to buy the newly released [OCP: Oracle Certified Professional Java Se 8 Programmer II Study Guide: Exam 1Z0-809](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23650477-ocp).
It was a really good purchase. 

The book is awesome. It has a similar style and feel as the [OCA: Oracle Certified Associate Java Se 8 Programmer I Study Guide: Exam 1z0-808](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23059696-oca?from_search=true&search_version=service).
It covers many new features, in details, introduced in ``java 8``.
I learn a lot about ``lambda``, ``collection streams``, ``date api`` 
and so on. I can tell you that this book was worth its money.

It took me almost 4 months to go through this book. To be honest I read
it two times. Same as previously ([OCA - review]({% post_url 2016-05-15-oracle-certified-associate-java-se-8-programmer-1z0-808-exam-review %})) 
I was generally reading the book during my way to work. 
First time I really haven't paid attention on solving tests. 
I have just gone through the book to better know
``java 8``. After that I took a few weeks break. When I started solving
test questions I noticed that I had a problem with ``java API``. It is
really annoying that the test exam requires from developer to remember
api. In 2016 we have ``ides``, written mainly for this purpose. Due this
fact I started reading a book again. This time however, 
I have been solving test question just after I read a chapter.

In order to prepare to the final exam I used [sybex](https://sybextestbanks.wiley.com/public/)
platform. Due the fact that I bought the book I got an access to this
site where I found 411 test questions divided into 3 sets:

* Assessment Test (20) - helps you focus your study to specific objectives
* Chapter Tests (211) - taken from the Review Questions at the end of chapters in the book
* Practice Exam (180) - provided to help you prepare for the certification test

Moreover I had an access to the following resources:

* Flashcards - help to reinforce your learning and provide last-minute test prep before the exam
* Searchable Glossary - instant access to the key terms youâ€™ll need to know for the exam
* Bonus Appendix - provides additional information about JavaScript with Nashorn, and 
  enables you to test your knowledge and understanding of this topic.
  
The exam lasted 150 minutes. At the end of the exam I still haven't 
answered on the two questions. I can say that the exam was much more 
difficult than the [Java SE 8 Programmer 1Z0-808 Exam](https://education.oracle.com/pls/web_prod-plq-dad/db_pages.getpage?page_id=5001&get_params=p_exam_id:1Z0-808).

After receiving the email that my exam results were available I browsed to 
the **CertView** and it appeared that I scored ``83%``.

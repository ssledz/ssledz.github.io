It passed almost 5 months since I have been learning *Scala* programming language. This learning is a part of bigger 
path which I decided to go through to be more familiar with current trends in *big data*, *machine learning* and 
*cloud computing*. 
 
When I decided to start learning scala the first question coming into my mind was how to start ? 

Because I am rather a fun of books, I bought one - __"Programming Scala: Scalability = Functional Programming + Objects" 
by Dean Wampler and Alex Payne"__ and started reading.... but this was not a good idea. The book I have chosen was 
written in not an easy going style and I think was too hard for the beginning. After few hundreds of pages I felt lost.
At the same time on *coursera* __'Functional Programming Principles in Scala'__ course was reactivated.
Not thinking too much I signed in and started participating. After few weeks I earn a certificate of accomplishment 
but this was not an end of my journey. I started participating in another course 
__"Functional Program Design in Scala"__ from the same author (Martin Odersky) as the previous one. In parallel I have 
started reading a book __"Programming in Scala Second Edition" by Martin Odersky, Lex Spoon, Bill Venners__ 
and I found it very helpful. Currently (in the time of writing this post) I have done __"Parallel programming"__ 
course and already enrolled for a __"Big Data Analysis with Scala and Spark"__ (still waiting for course publishing)

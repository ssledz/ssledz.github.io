[Automata course](https://class.coursera.org/automata-004) was six weeks long. Before taking the course I had some prior knowledge about ```automata```, ```regular expressions```, ```context free grammar```, ```turing machine``` and ```np-completeness```. In my opinion most of the lectures was clear and understandable. I found it very helpful to have a quizzes during each one. They were keeping me up on the track for a whole time. After each module there was a homework consisting of some test questions. For me those homeworks were the most valuable components of the course. It helped me a lot to fully understand the materials. 

Of course not everything was straight forward. The most dificult topic, for me, was ```np-completeness```. To be honest I didn't fully understand it. I can only guessing that it was caused by the fact that I haven't spent as much time during study as I should. Maybe I will return to that but now there are much more important things to do on top of my todo list.

After taking a final exam I have earned ```Statement of Accomplishment``` attached below.

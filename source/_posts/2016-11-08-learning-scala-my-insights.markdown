It passed almost 5 months since I have been learning *Scala* programming language. This learning is a part of bigger 
path which I decided to go through to be more familiar with current trends in *big data*, *machine learning* and 
*cloud computing*. 
 
When I decided to start learning scala the first question coming into my mind was how to start ? Because of I am 
rather a fun of books I bought a book - __"Programming Scala: Scalability = Functional Programming + Objects" 
by Dean Wampler and Alex Payne"__ and started reading.... but this was not a good idea. The book I have chosen was too 
complex for me. After few hundreds of pages I felt lost. At the same time on *coursera* 
__'Functional Programming Principles in Scala'__ course was reactivated so I signed in and started participating. 
After few weeks I earn a certificate of accomplishment but this was not an end of my journey. I started participating
 in another course __"Functional Program Design in Scala"__ from the same author (Martin Odersky) as the former. In 
 parallel I have started reading a book 
 __"Programming in Scala Second Edition" by Martin Odersky, Lex Spoon, Bill Venners__ and I found it very helpful.
